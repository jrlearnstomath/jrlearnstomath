- 👋 Hi, I’m JR!
- 👀 I am a second-year undergrad studying math part-time while working. I'm learning category theory on the side from books, videos, and an excellent tutor. I am using the active inference framework consciously through this learning process.
- 🌱 I’m learning haskell and how to be on github.
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them, she/her
